Having used Three.js a lot, and at the suggestion of Bartek Drozdz, I decided to sit down and create a simple 3D engine in JavaScript and WebGL. I have a lot of experience building sites and applications, but I've never built an engine before, nor created anything specifically with other developers in mind.  To the right are some samples built using the engine. All the source code for these and the engine itself can be found on GitHub. I'd be fascinated to see what someone else could build with the engine, so if you use it for anything let me know!
